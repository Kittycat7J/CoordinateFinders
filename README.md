# CoordinateFinders

CoordinateFinders is a web-based toolkit for deducing Minecraft world coordinates from screenshotsâ€”without needing the F3 debug screen. It provides tools for both **cloud pattern matching** and **block texture rotation analysis**, enabling users to reverse-engineer coordinates using in-game visual cues.

## Features

- **Cloud Pattern Finder:**  
  Estimate Z and Y coordinates by matching cloud patterns in screenshots to the Minecraft cloud texture.  
  - Supports different Minecraft versions (25w20a- and 25w21a+).
  - Input your observed cloud pattern to get possible coordinate matches.

- **Texture Rotation Classifier:**  
  Use AI to detect block texture rotations (e.g., grass, stone) in screenshots and infer possible world coordinates.  
  - Upload a screenshot, mark the area, and let the tool analyze block rotations.
  - Supports ground blocks (grass, etc.) for Minecraft 1.8+.
  - Export rotation data for use in coordinate-finding tools.

- **Training and Data Generation Scripts:**  
  Python scripts for generating training data and training new AI models for block rotation detection.

## Usage

### Online Tools

- **Home:** Overview and navigation.
- **Clouds:**  
  1. Enter your observed cloud pattern (using 0, 1, and ? for unknowns).
  2. Select the correct Minecraft version.
  3. Get estimated Z coordinates and pixel locations in the cloud texture.

- **Textures:**  
  1. Upload a screenshot.
  2. Adjust the perspective grid to match the in-game area.
  3. Click grid squares to run AI detection on block textures.
  4. Export rotation info for further analysis.

### Training Your Own Models

See [`textures/usage.md`](textures/usage.md) for detailed instructions:
- Generate data with `generate_variants.py`.
- Train models with `train.py`.
- Export trained models to TensorFlow.js format for use in the web app.
