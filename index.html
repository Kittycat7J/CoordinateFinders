      <h2>Info</h2>
      <p>
        Coordinates are helpful. Whether in the seedcracking process or if you want to find someone's base. But F3 is the only way you can find the coordinates of a screenshot, right? 

        The answer is NO! There are many other ways to obtain coordinates, such as grass offsets and texture rotations. This website has a built in tool to find the coordinates using clouds or texture rotations.

      <h2>Steps</h2>

      <h3>Clouds</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Clouds may look random but they are actually a huge png file. It is 256x256 pixels, and each pixel represents a blob. A cloud blob is 12x8x12.</li>

          <li>However, you can only obtain the estimated z and y coordinates using clouds as the x coordinate will always change due to clouds moving.</li>

          <li>This tool is designed to find the estimated z coords using clouds. It works by entering your pattern.txt

          0 means no cloud blob, 1 means yes cloud blob, and ? means idk

          Type your data into the pattern. Make sure that their are the same number of characters in each line so...

          This is not okay
          01010100
          000

          But this is

          01010100
          000?????.</li>

          <li>It then should post the direction of your screenshot, the estimated z coordinates in the spawnrange of 10,000 blocks, and the pixel coordinates of where the cloud patch is in the texture file.
          If you get multiple matches and you want to narrow it down to one, you need to enter more data..
